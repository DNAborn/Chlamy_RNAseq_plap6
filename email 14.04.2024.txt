Hi Simon,

for the first Fibrillin paper, as we talked would be great if I have these four plot separately as follow:
  1. In WT/cia5 mutant cells; gene expression of :
  -Rubisco large sub unit (rbcL)
-PLAP6 (Fibrillin)
2. In WT/plap6 mutant cells gene;
- gene expression of Cia5 in TAP and HSM (Supplementary Fig. 2)
- gene expression of rbcL in TAP (Supplementary Fig. 4).

Thanks a lot.
Best,
Yousef
